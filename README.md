# Project 2: Paintings Page #

### Description ###

Hello web developers! This project is a single page web application built using REACT. It allows you to browse some of my favorite pieces of art, as well as add your own! 

### Instructions ###

* Clone the forked repository
* Load server by running in terminal:
    * --watch db.json
* In terminal run 
    * npm install

### How to use ###
This web application is very simple! Once you have the application opened up and your server running, you can toggle between pages using the navigation bar at the top right corner. The "Home" page just gives a quick explanation of the applications purpose. The "Paintings" page allows you to view all of the paintings uploaded, and the "Add a painting" page lets you submit a new painting to the Paintings page.
